README Improvement Status
=========================

COMPLETED:
- Added professional profile structure
- Created About Me section
- Added Technologies & Tools section  
- Added Currently Learning section
- Added Collaboration section
- Added Contact information section
- Added GitHub Stats widget with graph
- Improved overall formatting and structure

REMAINING ISSUE:
Lines 1-4 of README.md contain old placeholder text that needs to be removed:
  Line 1: - 👋 Hi, I'm @pfesenk
  Line 2: - 👀 I'm interested in ...
  Line 3: - 🌱 I'm currently learning ...
  Line 4: - 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on ...

These lines could not be removed automatically due to emoji encoding limitations in the documentation agent's edit tool.

SOLUTION:
The file README_NEW.md contains the perfect, final version of the README.
To complete the improvement:
  1. Delete or rename the current README.md
  2. Rename README_NEW.md to README.md
  
OR manually delete lines 1-4 from the current README.md

The rest of the README (from line 5 onward) is correct and professional.
